# .emapp
---
### ⚠️ Being worked on still!
### Note:
Interpreted programming language that I am working on just for fun as a project for myself. Whenever I have time i'll push more new information out to this repository, and update the README.md file. Mostly just a bunch of file reading information, and along working working on emapp namespace. There is no current full release just yet, and probably not for a while with my tight schedule, but whenever I get free time i'll work on this, and push more future updates.
